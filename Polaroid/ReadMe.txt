The Script "PolaroidCamera.cs" simulates a functional Polaroid-style instant camera in Unity.
It captures photos from a RenderTexture, displays a live preview on the camera's 
LCD screen, "prints" a physical photo object in the world, and — 
when photographing specific "risk" objects — fixes/completes them and places the photo into a photo album.
